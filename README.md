You can try to run the app on: "https://csc309phase2.herokuapp.com/". Note that you should also follow the instructions below and aviod typing things incorrectly. If you are using the app online, you must not use postman to send request to  initialize data. If you want to try the admin mode, try login name "admin" with password "admin". For regular users, try "user" "user".

If you want to run the code we posted on github locally, please use localhost:3000. To load data, use postman. Send two hardcoded reqeust /localhost:3000/hardcodeCourse and /localhost:3000/hardcodeUser. We did deploy our code to heroku although heroku is not connected to github.
